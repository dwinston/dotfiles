    <h2>Pushing? Following?</h2>
    <p>
      If you <em>push</em> a proposal and enough other people do too
      (currently, quorum is {{quorum}} people), then the game is on,
      and you get an email. If you <em>follow</em> a proposal, then
      you get an email if enough other people are either following or
      pushing ("enough" because the game would be on if you all
      pushed).
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a game is on, anyone can mark that they are attending (if
      you were pushing, you are automatically marked as attending, but
      you can change that).
    </p>
    <h2>What about ...?</h2>
    <p>
      Push Pickup is just getting started, so it's hard to predict
      what a new user will have trouble doing.  If you need help,
      email me at
      <a href="mailto:donny@pushpickup.com">donny@pushpickup.com</a>.
    <p>
      Together, we can build a great "Help" section with answers to
      frequently asked questions, or, better yet, improve the site to
      keep this section small. :) Thanks for your patience.
