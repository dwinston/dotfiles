      Push Pickup helps you push for a game of
      pickup <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_(sport)"
                target="_blank">ultimate frisbee</a> at a time you want, at a
      field near you.

    <h2>Can't make a regular pickup game?</h2> 
    <p class="long">
      <a href="http://pickupultimate.com" target="_blank">
        Pickupultimate.com </a> is great for finding established,
      regularly scheduled pickup games.  But if you can't play in
      an existing regular game, Push Pickup helps you connect with
      people who live or work near a field and who want to play
      pickup ultimate frisbee, even if everyone's individual
      availabilities vary from week to week.

    <h2>
      Already part of a regular pickup game with an email list?
    </h2>
    <p class="long">
      Push Pickup helps reduce unnecessary group messages such as
      "Who's in today?", "Can we start a bit earlier?", "I'm in.",
      "I'm in.", "I'm in but I'll be late today.", "We need more
      people. Anyone?", and "Is the game on?".
    </p> 
    <h2>
      Having trouble scheduling occasional games?
    </h2>
    <p class="long"> Push Pickup helps you and people near you pool
      together your availabilities and commit to games. Tell your
      friends, and meet new friends who happen to be available to play
      when you are. :)
